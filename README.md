# LGM-Web-Development-Internship
These are the tasks performed by me in my time of internship at Lets Grow More (LGM).

I have performed a total of 2 Tasks out of 3 Tasks and created one branch for each task.

In the first task I have used HTML, CSS, Javascript and prepared a blog website on my 
favorite football club Manchester United.

In the second task I have created a create react app where the task is to create a 
User grid layout and to make an API call to get the user data.
